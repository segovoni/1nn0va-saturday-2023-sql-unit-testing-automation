# 1nn0va Saturday 2023

This repository contains the demos of the session "SQL Server unit testing with tSQLt, Docker and GitHub Actions" that I have done at the [1nn0va Saturday 2023](https://1nn0vasat2023.1nn0va.it/agenda.html) event!

## Run this sample

You can repeat the demo in your own GitHub repository by following the steps described in [this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/blob/master/samples/containers/unit-testing/tsqlt-docker/README.md) on [microsoft/sql-server-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples).

## Summary

Unit tests developed for a SQL Server solution are not just meant to verify that requirements have been met once, prior to release. The real game changer is represented by the possibility of repeating the checks during the development of new code and during the bug fixing process. The repeatability of the tests provides the ability to automate them, an essential condition for integrating automatic tests within a Continuous Integration platform.

Have fun with SQL Server, tSQLt, Docker and GitHub Actions!
